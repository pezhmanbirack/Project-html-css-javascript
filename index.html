        <h4>Microsoft Patch Management For Home Users</h4>
        <p>Last month, my wife, Anne Doe, took me to Las Vegas because he had to go for a business convention<br>
            convention. Needless to say, she writes for an guide to casinos and I hate gambling. But then, she<br>
            Needless to say, she writes for an guide to casinos and I hate gambling. But then, she<br>
            likes it and this supports us too, so I went along without any hassle. At first I was depressed, but<br>
        </p>
        <h5>Entertainment</h5>
        <p>One of the greatest things about Las Vegas, Reno and Atlantic City (but especially Las Vegas) is the<br>
        number of shows that are available. You can get to watch top class comedians like Jay Leno, Jerry <br>
        Seinfeld, Ray Romano, Tim Allen and even the likes of Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. If you are into music<br>
        you can watch female singers like Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and <br>
        Beyonc?, male performers like Phil Collins, Eric Clapton, Snoopy Dog and bands like Oasis and Bon <br>
        Jovi. I could go on and on but the list is endless. If you are into magic you can watch magicians like <br>
        David Copperfield do their thing meters from you. Whatever you like, you can find it here from<br>
        Western music to oldies to Jazz, Rock, Heavy Mettle to Trance. All you have to do is look at the<br>
        itenary offered during your visit.
        </p>
        <h5>Food</h5>
        <p>Chinese to Japanese to Korean to Jewish and even Vegetarian and proper meat eating<br>
            establishments await your every delight in Vegas. Do not opt for the cheap and oily fried dishes<br>
            served for free while you play. Stop a while and take in the delightful scenery and smells of East<br>
            Asian or European dishes. What is wondrous is that you get to see man’s ability to mix.<br>
            A real melting pot if I may say so myself.<br>
            <br>But is that all what casino cities like Las Vegas are about? Do you have to remain in the city to really<br>
             and truly enjoy your stay? No.</p>

        <h4>Here are some of the better attractions you<br> must see on your visit to Vegas:</h4>
        <p>Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon: Book yourself a seat on any of the many sightseeing tours<br>
            available and go and watch the architectural marvel that is Hoover Dam built over the Grand canyon<br>
            which is also a grand sight to see by itself. Black Canyon is another must see as is Lake Mead which <br>
            is so beautiful just because it is a body of water all surrounded by desert-like nature. Colorado River:<br>
            <br>
            While looking at the Dam and Canyon is from above, to see the true beauty of the river, you have to<br>
            go down. The Colorado river is excellent for river-rafting and water sports, but you do not have to <br>
            take part if it is not your thing. Instead just sit back and enjoy another of nature’s marvels.
        </p>
        <h5>Bonnie Springs</h5>
        <p>Who can not resist going to one of the old towns like those in the Western gun slinging movies? Your<br>
            destination needs to be Old Nevada. There you can delight in an old western town right in the<br>
            middle of Red Rock Canyon. They host western shootouts too so come prepared, partner! I could go<br>
            on and on about other attractions like the theme park in Circus Circus, the Gilcrease Nature <br>
            Sanctuary, the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve and Mt. Charleston but I think you get the picture.<br>
            In Las Vegas and hate gambling? Do not despair. Just go out and have some clean un-gambling fun.
